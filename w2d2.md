## REST = Representational State Transfer

B - Browse /users
R - Read /users/:id (Ex: /users/12)
E - Edit /users/:id/edit (Ex: /users/12/edit)
A - Add /users/new
D - Delete /users/:id/delete (Ex: /users/12/delete)

Edit, Add, Delete depends on permission.

Common URL Patterns in REST:
/nouns
/nouns/id
/nouns/id/verb
/nouns/id/associatedNouns

Client and server are seperated

Node is a non-blocking i/o

REST is an architectural principle that allows you to set the expectation for the state of the data that will be transferred with each request.


## JSON

JSON is not JavaScript
JSON looks like raw data = string representation of data
