##The Full Stack

Web dev = distribution of software over many computers

Standard way for computer to communicate with one another

A web broswer is a user-agent (Communicate with other computers on your behalf)

HTTP = Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (Standardized communication) (Requests and Receives)

HTTP Request message can have different headers (i.e Host: www.example.com)
Server (i.e IP 93.184.216.34) can have multiple websites (that's why we specify host)
