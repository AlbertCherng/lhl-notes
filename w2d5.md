## MongoDB

How we currently create "database":

var urlDatabase = {
  "abc": "http://"
  "def": "http://"
  "ghi": "http://"
}

Biggest problem is that this is IN MEMORY and not ON DISK

We need to serialize and persist this object on disk ("file system").

Either binary are text files are often used to store long term info.

Ideally our app will persist this object on disk and then read/write from that file.

CSV Files are the simplest but least powerful appraoch.
Comma Seperrated Values and it's just a text file that has each record on one line separated by commas.

CSV

"abc", "http://"
"def", "http://"

JSON is another appraoch to storing our data, but again struggles with the same challenges (too much work on the app developer to work with this file in terms of searching, constatnly, updating it, etc.)

Javascript JSON
{

  "abc": "http://"
  "def": "http://"
  "ghi": "http://"
}


### Enter MongoDB (or other alternatives)

MongoDB is a document storage database (Most popular option at present and it blew up big time in the Node/JS community).

It is open source.

It is a non-relational db and is more of an object store.

The major components of Mongo are:

-Databases (Each app usually has one)
  -Collections (Array)
    -Documents (JS Objects with _ids's)



### Transactional Function/Operations

CRUD - Create Read Update Delete


### How Browser, Node/Express and MongoDB Communicate

Browser (Client) <> Node/Express (Server)
Node/Express (Client) <> MongoDB (Server)
Browser <> Node/Express (Server/Client) <> MongoDB (Server)
