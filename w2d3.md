## Review

### HTTP
-Protocol (Rules for two entities talking to each other)
-Client and Server
-Uses text
-Request and Responses both have head and body
-Request Head (What the request needs (i.e GET, User-Agent, etc.) )
-Response Head (Response info (i.e. Status Codes, Content type, etc.) )
-Body (Whatever we want)
-Each request is independent
-Stateless (Client and server don't really remember anything)
-URLs

### REST

### JSON
-A way of representing data as text


### Web Server
