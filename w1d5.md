LSD: Logic syntacs data
jS counts time in milliseconds

module.export = used for exporting module (i.e. bomb )
Use it as a vehicle to take functionality to another app

require.(filesIwant) = used for importing module

npm = node package manager

dsl = domain specific language


##Testing

Mocha & Chai = two popular libraries for testing

mocha = testing language (provides actual testing methods)

chai = sets up tests

Words used in testing

describe = groups test together & gives context

tests can be created before you write your code (setting expectations)

OR it can be created after you write your code (validating it works)
