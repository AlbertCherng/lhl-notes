# Notes w1d3

*Primitive converts to object (adds functionality)
*Primitive values get passed to functions
*Objects are different from primitive
*When an object is passed into function, JS refers to the original object

var obj = {
  name: "Albert",
  age: "44",
};

obj.hobby = "3D Printing";

obj ["fav_colour"] = "Orange";

*Objects are useful for storing data

*this.XXXX is helpful when calling values from (or referring) object within the scope of a object
