# Notes w1d2

**Approach is key.**

*Breaking the problem down
*Inner voice and conversation
*Working iteratively
*Expecting outcome before running

Debugging
Research and discover (never ends)


You can test code by:
1) REPL in terminal (node)
2) Within .js file

**Do things step by step**

*Try refactoring as you go

*Ideally functions should be a "verb"

*Look at code by the nesting level

*Try putting function at the very top

Debugger

*Stops code "in time"
*Add "debugger", in .js file
*From node, jump to debug
*repl
*Use n(or next) to jump to next code

Be aware of scope


Afternoon Breakout

How to read code?

*Generally top to bottom
*Skip over functions & variable until they are called
