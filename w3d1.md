# Notes w3d1

## HTML
- Markup Langugage
- Provides structure to the browser
  - Nested object
  - Tree-like structure (AKA DOM: document-object-model)
- Describes the content but NOT the way it appears on the page

## CSS
- Deals with styling
- How to decorate the html
- Colours, fonts, etc.
- LAYOUT: describes how things position on the page not just how they look

## JS
- Functionality
- Only non-declarative language in the front-end
- Serves as the bridge between the DOM and user


## Difference between padding and margins

Padding is the space inside the element
Margins is the space outside the element
